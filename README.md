# Data-Driven-Forecasting-Taylor-Method
There are two python files in this folder which work very similarly. The first is TayDDF.py which performs Data Driven Forecasting with the Taylor order only going up to 2nd order; it is the simpler and quicker of the two files. The MultiTayDDF.py is a more flexible version (also slower and more complex) which can handle any order of the Taylor expansion of the unknown differential equations of the system being studied. See the comments in the python scripts for more details. I also include a jupyter notebook I used to generate the data to test chaotic models on DDF.
And finally, I include a few pictures of a result from this method to show its efficacy.
